#JFFTPack

I've only took this project, and set Gradle as build system in order to make it easier to use. In case you have any doubt, please contact me at fjfdeztoro at gmail dot com.

### Old readme content
<pre>
jfftpack is a Java version of fftpack. 
jfftpack is based on Paul N. Swarztraubre's Fortran code and Pekka Janhuen's C code. 
It is developed as part of my official duties as lead software engineer for SCUBA-2 FTS projects (www.roe.ac.uk/ukatc/projects/scubatwo/)

The original fftpack was public domain, so jfftpack is public domain too. This software is in no way certified or guaranteed.

Please send any comments or bug reports to baoshe.zhang at
